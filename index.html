        <p>With the success of previous MSR Image Retrieval/Recognition Challenges (MSR IRC) at IEEE ICME, ACM Multimedia 2014 and 2015, Microsoft Research is happy to announce MSR IRC at ACM MM 2016, based on real world large scale dataset, and open evaluation system.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the advance of deep learning algorithms, great progresses have been made in visual recognition in the past several
        years. But, there is still a big gap from these academic innovations and practical intelligent services, due to the lack
        of: (1) real world large scale data with better quality for training and evaluation. (2) public platform to conduct fair,
        efficient evaluations and make the recognition result reproducible and accessible.</p>

        <p>To further motivate and challenge the academic and industrial research community, Microsoft is releasing MS-Celeb-1M, a large scale real world face image dataset to public, encouraging researchers to develop the best face recognition techniques to recognize one million people entities identified from Freebase. In its V1.0 version, the dataset contains 10M celebrity face images for the top 100K celebrities, which can be used to train and evaluate both face identification and verification algorithms.</p>

        <p>Moreover, Microsoft Research has developed Prajna Hub, an open multimedia gateway, to convert latest algorithms into online services that can be accessed by anybody, from anywhere, and make the evaluation/test results repeatable and comparable.</p>

        <p>By participating in this challenge, you can:<p>

        <ul>
          <li>Leverage real world large scale face dataset for celebrity recognition;</li>
          <li>Try out your image recognition system using real world data;</li>
          <li>See how it compares to the rest of the communityâ€™s entries;</li>
          <li>Get to be a contender for ACM Multimedia 2016 Grand Challenge;</li>
        </ul>

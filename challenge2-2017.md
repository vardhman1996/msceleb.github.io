# Low-shot Learning 

## Task Description

Recognizing one million celebrities naturally introduces the **low-shot learning** problem since many celebrities have limited number of images available. 
Though human visual intelligence has the ability to recognize novel objects from very few examples, low-shot learning with machines is still an open problem. 

In this topic, the challenge is to recognize one thousand celebrities, each with only limited number (for example, 1, 2, 5) of training images provided.
 Besides the training and testing data for these 1000 celebrities, we also provide a base set of other 20K celebrities which are a subset of the MS-Celeb-1M dataset. 
 To assist the learning of face recognition feature, we have run a data cleaning algorithm and ended up having 60-100 face images for each celebrity. 
 This base set has yielded a cutting-edge performance (~99%) with the standard ResNet model on the LFW face verification task. 
 Participants are encouraged, but not forced, to use this base set to train a model with general face perception to benefit the final target.

**Note: Commercial/public intelligent services are not allowed to be called during the evaluation, e.g. [Microsoft Cognitive Servcies](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services), etc. We will detect and ban the contestants for this kind of behavior.**
